    <h2>Apology To My Darling</h2>

    <p>
        Dear Darling, When I first met you, I promised not only to you but also to myself, that I would do whatever I can to make you feel happy. Something that, judging by how you’ve been acting towards me the past few days, I’ve failed miserably to accomplish. Yet, I want you to know that all of my actions have been towards that goal, making you the happiest woman on earth. Thus, seeing you unhappy really breaks my heart, especially knowing that those feelings derive from my actions. I also want you to know that I will do whatever it takes, whatever you ask, whatever needed to get you back, to make you forgive me. You truly are the love of my life, and I cannot imagine how my life would be without you. The only thing I want is to make you happy, I love you. To make up for my actions, please allow me to treat you to your favourite meal which is grilled cheese sandwich with tomato, after that a movie and a little outing/activity.
    </p>
